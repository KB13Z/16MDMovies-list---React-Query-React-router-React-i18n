                This project is made by a Codelex student - Laura.<br />
                Bonus task is not added, as one little monster was not letting the author sleep for five nights in the row.<br />
                Therefore it is a miracle, that the project with main tasks has been submitted only 7 days late.<br />
                Or submitted at all.<br />
                At one moment, author already had lost all hope...<br />
                For those, who are interested, how does the monster look like â†“
